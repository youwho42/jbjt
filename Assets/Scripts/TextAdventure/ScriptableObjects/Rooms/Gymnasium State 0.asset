  description: "You are in the <b>gymnasium</b>.\n \nBats, spiders and a who\u2019s
    who of movie monsters adorn the walls, but, a <b>basketball</b> under the bleachers
    reminds you the space is usually used for sports rather than dancing.\n \nA few
    ounces of bright red <b>punch</b> remain in a bowl on a table, beside a <b>snack</b>
    that looks like a cross between a hot dog and a baby\u2019s finger\n \nThe song
    Leaving on a Jet Plane is playing softly on a radio in the corner.\n \nThere is
    a door to the <b>south</b>."
