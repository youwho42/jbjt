    textResponse: "You are in the <b>cafeteria</b>.\n \nThe room is surprisingly tidy,
      considering a hoard of adolescents were wolfing down their lunches a few hours
      ago. The long tables are spotless but a <b>book</b> sits forgotten on one of
      them. A small <b>can</b> is the only thing left on the food cart.\n \nThe lingering
      smell of old farts makes you think it might be Chuesday.\n \nThere is a door
      to the <b>south</b>."
